# 📙 What is Open Source?

Open source software (OSS) is code that is publicly accessible — anyone can see, modify, and distribute the code as they wish.\
It is developed in a decentralized and collaborative way, relying on peer review and community contributions.

Open source projects often last longer, are more flexible, and cost less than proprietary ones because they are maintained by communities rather than a single company.\
Beyond software, open source is now a **movement** and a **way of working** to solve problems collaboratively.

# 📂 Suggested Folder Structure

To make PyVerse easier to contribute to, we suggest the following modular folder structure:

```
pyverse/
│
├── projects
├── docs/                # Documentation
├── CONTRIBUTERS.md      # Contributor list
└── README.md
```

This helps new contributors understand where files belong and reduces merge conflicts.
