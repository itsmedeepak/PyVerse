# Algorithm Visualizer

A beginner-friendly Python project to visualize common graph algorithms:

- BFS (Breadth-First Search)
- DFS (Depth-First Search)
- UCS (Uniform Cost Search)

## Features
- Input start node interactively
- Shows BFS and DFS visiting order
- Shows UCS visiting order with cumulative costs
- Beginner-friendly, perfect for learning algorithms

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `main.py`:
```bash
python main.py
```
3. Enter the start node when prompted

✅ **Next Steps / Optional Enhancements**
1. **ASCII Graph Visualization** – print the graph structure in terminal.  
2. **Weighted Graph Input** – allow user to enter graph interactively.  
3. **Step-by-Step Traversal** – show node visiting sequence one step at a time.  
4. **GUI Version** – use `Tkinter` or `pygame` to visually show traversal.  
5. **Support More Algorithms** – Dijkstra, A*, topological sort, etc.
