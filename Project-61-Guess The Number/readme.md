## How It Works
* The computer picks a random number between 1 and 100.

* You keep guessing until you find the correct number.

* It tells you whether to go higher or lower.

* Once you guess correctly, it shows how many attempts you took.

* You can play again without restarting the program.

## Optional Upgrades To The Code 
* Add difficulty levels (Easy: 1–50, Hard: 1–500)
* Track best score (minimum attempts)
