## 🎮 Gameplay Rules

* You will choose either to **bat** or **bowl** first.
* For each ball, select a number (e.g., `0–6`) and the CPU will also choose.
* If both numbers match → **Wicket falls!**
* Otherwise → Runs are added to the score.
* The second innings is a **chase**: reach the target before overs run out.

## 📸 Example Run

```
Welcome to the Cricket Game!
Choose your role (bat/bowl): bat
You are batting for 2 overs.
Ball 1: Enter your shot (0–6): 4
CPU bowled: 2 → You scored 4 runs!
...
```

## 🛠️ Customization

You can edit:

* **Overs per match** in the code.
* **Delay speed** in commentary (`slowprint`).
