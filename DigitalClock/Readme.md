📌 Project Overview

This project aims to create an interactive and visually clean digital clock that goes beyond showing time — users can:

View real-time hours, minutes, and seconds

Set alarms and receive alerts when time is reached

Use a stopwatch (start, pause, reset)

Run a countdown timer

Choose their mood (Happy, Neutral, Sad) via UI buttons

It’s a beginner-friendly front-end project showcasing JavaScript’s handling of real-time updates, DOM manipulation, and event handling.
